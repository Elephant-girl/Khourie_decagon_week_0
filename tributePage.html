                        In a time when women had limited options, Freda chose to chart her own path and defy social norms at the time in a socially conservative country like mexico. She refused to just be known as <em>"just the wife of a famuos painter"</em>, she decided to chart her own path. As a result, decades later, she is still regarded as being one of the most important artists of her time, with her works beind displayed in museums world wide.
